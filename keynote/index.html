						<h3>Wednesday, September 21, 2022 <small>3:30pm - 5pm</small> In-Person</h3>
						<h2>Conrad Tucker </h2>
						<h3><small>Professor at Carnegie Mellon University</small> </h3>
						<p>Conrad Tucker is an Arthur Hamerschlag Career Development Professor of Mechanical Engineering and holds courtesy faculty appointments in machine learning, robotics, and biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. His research focuses on the design and optimization of systems through the acquisition, integration, and mining of large scale, disparate data. Tucker has served as PI/Co-PI on federally/non-federally funded grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the Office of Naval Research (ONR) via the NSF Center for eDesign, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). In February 2016, he was invited by National Academy of Engineering (NAE) President Dr. Dan Mote, to serve as a member of the Advisory Committee for the NAE Frontiers of Engineering Education (FOEE) Symposium.

						<h3>Talk title: "In Search of Ground Truth: From Social Media Networks to Deep Neural Networks"</h3>
						
						<!--<p>Abstract: Governments exists to support the sovereignty of its nation - its borders and people.  Decisions by the government on behalf of the populace should be made with the "best" interest in meeting their populace's needs.  What are these needs?  What will keep them happy?   In this presentation we will provide motivation as to the need for answers and take a walk through a series of research activities that were pursued to explore such questions.  We conclude by discussing the need for continued research, the motivation for SBP and its importance to the community.</p> -->

						<h2>Ariel M. Greenberg</h2>
						<h3><small>Project manager JHU/APL</small> </h3>
						<p>Ariel M. Greenberg is a senior staff scientist and project manager at JHU/APL with research interests in psychophysiology, behavioral modeling and simulation, and machine ethics. His work addresses topics in computational social and cognitive-affective science, toward applications in defense, intelligence, and public health. Alongside his research, Ariel develops and instructs courses, serves as assistant editor-in-chief of the Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, and steers the annual international SBP-BRiMS conference.

						<h3>Talk title: "Foundational Concepts in Person-Machine Teaming"</h3>
					<!--	<p>Abstract:  It has been nearly 30 years since the first BRIMS meeting and more than a dozen years since the first SBP meeting in 2008. While much has changed since then to advance the field, some things remain disappointingly the same â€“ and need to be addressed. Even so, the future for behavioral-social modeling and simulation (B-S M&S) is quite bright with a multitude of exciting opportunities just around the corner. After briefly reflecting on the progress made in behavioral representation in modeling and simulation, Dr. Mabry will share her thoughts on what recent events tell us about the future of the field, how we can prepare for it, and even shape it. As an interdisciplinary scientist who has spent over a decade of her career leading the systems science program out of the Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research at the (National Institutes of Health), and has been a researcher in small business, academia and a now in a health care system, Dr. Mabry has a unique multidimensional perspective on the value of B-S M&S and its applications. In this talk, she will identify opportunities and caveats for B-S M&S while challenging the audience to engage in self-reflection and critical thinking about how we can collaboratively take on the most pressing problems of our times. Dr. Mabry will share her optimistic vision of the future of B-S M&S and explain how a wide range of influences lead her to this deduction. Those influences include external events such as the rise of Artificial Intelligence, the COVID-19 pandemic, the quest for precision medicine, issues and opportunities in data and technology. She will also explain her passion for using B-S M&S methods to engage in the science of science, the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and suggest ways to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion in the field.</p> -->
